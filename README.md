My Portfolio Website

This is a webpage that I quickly made, because I was participating in a job selection and I needed some projects to show.
It got changed more than 5 times, including color schemes, ideas, different headers etc. 
I just started coding cause I didn't have a lot of time, so I had no prep before hand nor any type of structural or architectural ideas for it.

It is still lacking some refactoring and some scroll-animations that I intend to add later.

All the code is in the repo, you can check it out if you like!
