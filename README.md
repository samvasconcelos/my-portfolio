# my-portfolio

This is a webpage I put together quickly as I was in the midst of a job application process and needed some projects to showcase.
It got changed more than 5 times, including color schemes, ideas, different headers etc. 
I started coding without much time for preparation, lacking any specific structural or architectural concepts and ideas for it.

It is still lacking some refactoring and some scroll-animations that I intend to add later.

All the code is in the repo, you can check it out if you like!
