My Portfolio Website

This is a webpage I made within 2 weeks, in a rush, because I was participating in a job selection and I need some projects to show.
It got changed more than 5 times, including color schemes, ideas, different headers etc. I just started coding cause I didn't have a lot of time,
so I had no prep before nor any type of structural or architecture ideas for it.

It is still lacking some refactoring and some scroll-animations that I intend to add later.

All the code is in the repo, you can check it out if you like!
